# Rollbacks

If you have a problems after a [deployment](deployment.md), you can rollback to the previous version of the app.

1. SSH into the server.

2. Check the docker images to see the previous version of the app:

    ```console
    docker images torrust/tracker
    REPOSITORY        TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
    torrust/tracker   develop   b081a7499542   19 minutes ago   133MB
    torrust/tracker   <none>    7dbdad453cf3   6 hours ago      133MB
    ```

3. Tag the previous version of the app with a new name (e.g. `rollback`):

    ```console
    docker tag 7dbdad453cf3 torrust/tracker:rollback
    ```

    This command tags the image with ID `7dbdad453cf3` as `torrust/tracker:rollback`.

    ```console
      docker images torrust/tracker
        REPOSITORY        TAG        IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
        torrust/tracker   develop    b081a7499542   21 minutes ago   133MB
        torrust/tracker   rollback   7dbdad453cf3   6 hours ago      133MB
    ```

    The `rollback` tag now points to the previous version of the app.

4. Edit the `compose.yaml` file to use the new tag:

    Change the line:

    ```yaml
    image: torrust/tracker:develop
    ```

    to:

    ```yaml
    image: torrust/tracker:rollback
    ```

5. Run the following command to start the previous version of the app:

    ```console
    docker compose up --build --detach
    ```

6. Check the logs of the tracker container to see if everything is working:

    ```console
    ./share/bin/tracker-filtered-logs.sh
    ```
