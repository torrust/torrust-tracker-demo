# GitHub Copilot Instructions Update Summary

## Changes Made

Updated `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to include comprehensive guidance on the three-layer
testing architecture to prevent future violations of separation of concerns.

### 1. New Section: "Three-Layer Testing Architecture"

Added a detailed section under "Testing Requirements" that explains:

- **Critical importance** of maintaining layer separation
- **Definition of each layer**:
  - Project-Wide/Global Layer (`tests/` folder)
  - Infrastructure Layer (`infrastructure/` folder)
  - Application Layer (`application/` folder)
- **Specific responsibilities** for each layer
- **Clear hierarchy** showing orchestration relationships
- **Common mistakes to avoid** with explicit examples
- **GitHub Actions integration** guidance

### 2. Enhanced AI Assistant Guidelines

Added a specific "Testing Layer Separation (CRITICAL)" section in the AI assistants guidance that:

- **Reinforces the architecture** with strong warnings
- **Lists common violations** that should never happen
- **Provides clear guidance** on proper command usage
- **Emphasizes orchestration** through `make test-ci`

## Key Benefits

1. **Prevents regression** - Future contributors and AI assistants will understand the architecture
2. **Clear guidance** - Explicit examples of what NOT to do
3. **Proper orchestration** - Emphasizes using `make test-ci` for complete testing
4. **Maintainable architecture** - Each layer stays focused on its responsibilities

## Impact

This documentation update ensures that the three-layer testing architecture violation we just
fixed will not happen again. Contributors and AI assistants now have clear, explicit guidance
on maintaining proper separation of concerns in the testing infrastructure.

The documentation is strategically placed in both the general testing requirements and the AI
assistant-specific guidelines to ensure maximum visibility and adherence to the architecture.
