# Refactoring Documentation

This directory contains cross-cutting refactoring documentation. Component-specific
refactoring documentation has been moved to appropriate locations.

## File Relocations (July 2025)

The following files have been **moved** to better organize documentation:

### Moved to `infrastructure/docs/refactoring/twelve-factor-refactor/`

- `twelve-factor-implementation-status.md` → `current-status.md`
- `twelve-factor-refactoring-completed.md` → `integration-testing-improvements.md`

**Reason**: These documents are specific to infrastructure twelve-factor refactoring
and belong with the related implementation documentation.
