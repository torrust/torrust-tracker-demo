# Makefile Validation Checklist

This document tracks the comprehensive testing of all Makefile targets to ensure
they work correctly and provide the expected output.

## Epic Overview

**Goal**: Test all 27 Makefile targets systematically, ensuring each works as
expected and handles edge cases appropriately.

**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ In Progress

---

## Phase 1: Prerequisites and Basic Setup

### 1.1 Environment Validation

- [x] Test `make help` - Verify help message displays correctly âœ…
- [x] Test `make workflow-help` - Verify workflow guidance is clear âœ…
- [x] Check current system state - Document starting conditions âœ…

### 1.2 Dependency Management

- [ ] Test `make install-deps` (if not already installed)
  - [ ] Verify OpenTofu installation
  - [ ] Verify libvirt/KVM installation
  - [ ] Verify user group membership
  - [ ] Check service status
- [ ] Test `make check-libvirt` - Verify libvirt status check
- [ ] Test `make fix-libvirt` - Verify permission fixes work
- [ ] Test `make test-prereq` - Verify prerequisite validation

### 1.3 Development Setup

- [ ] Test `make dev-setup` - Complete development environment setup
- [ ] Test `make setup-ssh-key` - SSH key configuration
- [ ] Verify SSH key configuration is properly created

---

## Phase 2: Syntax and Configuration Testing

### 2.1 Configuration Validation

- [ ] Test `make test-syntax` - Validate all configuration files
- [ ] Test `make ci-test-syntax` - CI-specific syntax validation
- [ ] Test `make quick-test` - Quick validation without deployment

### 2.2 OpenTofu/Terraform Operations

- [ ] Test `make init` - Initialize OpenTofu
- [ ] Test `make plan` - Verify infrastructure planning
  - [ ] Test with valid SSH key configuration
  - [ ] Test without SSH key configuration (should fail gracefully)

---

## Phase 3: VM Lifecycle Management

### 3.1 VM Deployment

- [ ] Test `make apply-minimal` - Deploy VM with minimal configuration
  - [ ] Verify VM starts successfully
  - [ ] Verify SSH access works
  - [ ] Document VM status and capabilities
- [ ] Test `make apply` - Deploy VM with full configuration
  - [ ] Verify cloud-init completes successfully
  - [ ] Verify all services are installed and running
  - [ ] Document differences from minimal deployment

### 3.2 VM Management

- [ ] Test `make status` - Check infrastructure status
- [ ] Test `make ssh` - SSH connectivity
  - [ ] Test successful connection
  - [ ] Test failure when VM not deployed
- [ ] Test `make vm-restart` - VM restart functionality
- [ ] Test `make monitor-cloud-init` - Real-time monitoring

### 3.3 VM Cleanup

- [ ] Test `make destroy` - VM destruction
  - [ ] Verify complete cleanup
  - [ ] Verify state files are properly managed
- [ ] Test `make clean` - Temporary file cleanup
- [ ] Test `make clean-and-fix` - Complete cleanup and reset

---

## Phase 4: Testing and Validation

### 4.1 Test Suite Execution

- [ ] Test `make test` - Full test suite
  - [ ] Document test execution time
  - [ ] Verify all test components run
  - [ ] Check test output and logs
- [ ] Test `make test-integration` - Integration tests with deployed VM
- [ ] Test `make deploy-test` - Test deployment for validation

### 4.2 Workflow Testing

- [ ] Test `make restart-and-monitor` - Complete restart workflow
- [ ] Test `make fresh-start` - Alias verification

---

## Phase 5: Edge Cases and Error Handling

### 5.1 Error Conditions

- [ ] Test targets without prerequisites
  - [ ] SSH without deployed VM
  - [ ] Plan without SSH key configuration
  - [ ] Integration tests without VM
- [ ] Test with corrupted state files
- [ ] Test with permission issues
- [ ] Test with missing dependencies

### 5.2 Recovery Scenarios

- [ ] Test recovery from failed deployments
- [ ] Test multiple VM cleanup scenarios
- [ ] Test permission recovery

---

## Phase 6: Documentation and Validation

### 6.1 Output Validation

- [ ] Verify all help messages are accurate
- [ ] Verify error messages are helpful
- [ ] Document expected vs actual behavior for each target

### 6.2 Performance Testing

- [ ] Measure deployment times for different configurations
- [ ] Test concurrent operations (if applicable)
- [ ] Document resource usage
