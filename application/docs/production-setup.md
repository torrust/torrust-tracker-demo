# Setup

Follow instructions on [Deploying Torrust To Production](https://torrust.com/blog/deploying-torrust-to-production).

You need to also enable a [firewall](./firewall-requirements.md).

The application is located in the directory: `/home/torrust/github/torrust/torrust-tracker-demo`.

To run docker compose commands you need to cd to the app dir:

```console
cd /home/torrust/github/torrust/torrust-tracker-demo
```
