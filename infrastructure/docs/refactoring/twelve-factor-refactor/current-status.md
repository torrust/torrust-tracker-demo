# Twelve-Factor Refactoring - Current Status

## 📋 Progress Summary

🚧 **IN PROGRESS**: Twelve-factor refactoring is partially implemented with integration testing improvements

### ✅ Recently Completed (July 2025)

#### Integration Testing Workflow Improvements

- ✅ **Fixed local repository deployment**: `deploy-app.sh` now uses git archive instead of GitHub clone
- ✅ **Corrected endpoint validation**: Updated health checks for nginx proxy architecture
- ✅ **SSH authentication fixed**: Proper key-based authentication in cloud-init and scripts
- ✅ **Database migration**: Successfully migrated from SQLite to MySQL in local environment
- ✅ **Health check script updated**: All 14 validation tests now pass (100% success rate)
- ✅ **Integration testing debugged**: Complete end-to-end workflow now operational

#### Quality Improvements

- ✅ **Linting compliance**: All YAML, Shell, and Markdown files pass linting
- ✅ **Script improvements**: Enhanced error handling and logging
- ✅ **Documentation accuracy**: Updated guides to reflect current architecture

## 🎯 Current Status: INTEGRATION TESTING WORKFLOW OPERATIONAL

The **integration testing and deployment workflow is now fully functional** for
local development and testing.

### Working Commands (July 2025)

```bash
# Infrastructure management
make infra-apply ENVIRONMENT=local     # Deploy VM infrastructure
make infra-status ENVIRONMENT=local    # Check infrastructure status
make infra-destroy ENVIRONMENT=local   # Clean up infrastructure

# Application deployment (using local repository)
make app-deploy ENVIRONMENT=local      # Deploy application from local changes
make health-check ENVIRONMENT=local    # Validate deployment (14/14 tests)

# Quality assurance
make test-syntax         # Run all linting checks
```

### Legacy Commands (Still Work)

```bash
# Old commands work with deprecation warnings
make apply              # Shows warning, runs infra-apply + app-deploy
make destroy            # Shows warning, runs infra-destroy
make status             # Shows warning, runs infra-status
```

## 🚧 Twelve-Factor Refactoring Status

### ❌ **NOT YET IMPLEMENTED**: Full Twelve-Factor Configuration Management

The **core twelve-factor refactoring** described in the [original plan](./README.md) and
[Phase 1 implementation](./phase-1-implementation.md) is **still pending**.

#### What's Missing from Original Plan

- ❌ **Environment-based configuration**: Templates in `infrastructure/config/` not implemented
- ❌ **Configuration script**: `configure-env.sh` not created
- ❌ **Environment file processing**: `.env` generation from templates pending
- ❌ **Production environment**: Production configuration templates incomplete
- ❌ **Secret management**: External secret injection not implemented
- ❌ **Configuration validation**: Comprehensive validation script missing

#### Current Configuration Approach

- ✅ **Working**: Direct Docker Compose with hardcoded `.env.production`
- ✅ **Working**: Manual configuration file editing
- ❌ **Missing**: Template-based configuration generation
- ❌ **Missing**: Environment-specific variable injection

## 🎯 Next Steps: Complete Twelve-Factor Implementation

### Immediate Priority (Phase 1)

1. **Implement configuration management system** as described in [phase-1-implementation.md](./phase-1-implementation.md)
2. **Create environment templates** in `infrastructure/config/environments/`
3. **Build configuration processing script** (`configure-env.sh`)
4. **Update deployment scripts** to use template-based configuration

### Current vs Target Architecture

| Component              | Current State               | Twelve-Factor Target          |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Configuration          | Hardcoded `.env.production` | Template-based generation     |
| Secrets                | Committed to repo           | Environment variables         |
| Environment management | Manual                      | Automated template processing |
| Deployment             | Working (local)             | Working (multi-environment)   |

## 🔧 Testing Current Implementation

### Integration Testing (Working)

```bash
# Test current functional workflow
make infra-apply ENVIRONMENT=local
make app-deploy ENVIRONMENT=local
make health-check ENVIRONMENT=local
make infra-destroy ENVIRONMENT=local
```

### Configuration Management (Not Yet Available)

```bash
# These commands don't exist yet (twelve-factor goal)
make configure-local      # ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
make validate-config      # ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
```

## 📁 Current File Structure

### Recently Improved

```text
infrastructure/scripts/
├── provision-infrastructure.sh    # ✅ Working (VM provisioning)
├── deploy-app.sh                  # ✅ Fixed (local repo deployment)
└── health-check.sh               # ✅ Updated (all endpoints corrected)

Makefile                           # ✅ Updated (new workflow commands)
```

### Still Missing (Twelve-Factor Plan)

```

## 🎉 What's Actually Working (July 2025)

### 1. **Operational Integration Testing**

- Complete VM provisioning and application deployment
- All Docker services start correctly (MySQL, Tracker, Prometheus, Grafana, Nginx)
- All 14 health checks pass consistently
- Local repository changes are properly deployed and tested

### 2. **Improved Development Experience**

- SSH authentication works reliably
- Endpoint validation is accurate for nginx proxy architecture
- Error handling and logging throughout deployment process
- Consistent linting and code quality standards

### 3. **Architecture Stability**

- MySQL database integration functional
- Nginx reverse proxy configuration working
- All service ports and networking correct
- Docker Compose orchestration reliable

## 📖 Documentation Status

- ✅ [Integration testing workflow](../../../guides/integration-testing-guide.md) - Updated and accurate
- ✅ [Current status](./current-status.md) - This file, reflects actual state
- ✅ [Original twelve-factor plan](./README.md) - Still valid, needs implementation
- ✅ [Phase 1 implementation guide](./phase-1-implementation.md) - Detailed steps available
- ✅ [Integration test improvements](./integration-testing-improvements.md) - Summary of recent fixes

## 🔄 Summary: Where We Stand

### What Works Now ✅

- **Local development and testing**: Full workflow operational
- **Infrastructure provisioning**: OpenTofu + cloud-init working
- **Application deployment**: Docker Compose with proper service orchestration
- **Health validation**: Comprehensive endpoint and service testing
- **Code quality**: Linting and validation throughout

### What's Next ❌

- **Twelve-factor configuration management**: Implement template-based config system
- **Environment-specific deployments**: Build proper environment abstraction
- **Production hardening**: Complete production environment configuration
- **Multi-cloud support**: Extend beyond local KVM to cloud providers

The **integration testing improvements** are complete and working well.
The **twelve-factor configuration refactoring** is the next major milestone to implement.
