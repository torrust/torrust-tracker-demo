# Markdownlint Configuration

This file documents the markdownlint configuration for the project.

## Line Length Handling

The project enforces a 100-character line limit for markdown files (`MD013` rule).
Tables are automatically excluded from this limit to maintain readability.

### Table Line Length Configuration

Tables are configured to ignore line length limits globally via the `.markdownlint.json` configuration:

```json
"MD013": {
    "line_length": 100,
    "tables": false
}
```

This means:

- **Regular text**: Must stay within 100 characters per line
- **Tables**: Can exceed line length limits without linting errors
- **Code blocks**: Follow normal line length rules

### Alternative Approach

If you need to disable line length for specific non-table content, you can still use
markdownlint ignore blocks:

```markdown
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

Very long line content that needs to exceed the normal limit

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->
```
